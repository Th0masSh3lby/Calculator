This is a javascript calculator for Front end libraries certification

This code is for a simple calculator web application built using React. The calculator has a display area and buttons for numbers, decimal point, operators (+, -, *, /), clear (AC), and equals (=). The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations and evaluates the expression when the equals button is clicked. The code uses React hooks, specifically useState, to manage the state of the display area. The code also includes functions to handle button clicks for numbers, operators, decimal point, clear, and equals. The buttons are created dynamically using an array of objects, and the handleClick function for each button is passed as a prop.
